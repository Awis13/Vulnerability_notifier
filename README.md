##Title: Vulnerability Report Script and Workflow

###Overview:
This repository contains a script (notificator.py) that fetches, processes, and reports recent vulnerability releases from a specified GitHub repository. It filters out relevant vulnerabilities based on certain criteria, formats them into an HTML table, and sends out a daily email report. Additionally, a GitHub Actions workflow is set up to automate the running of this script on a daily basis, or upon pushes to the main branch, or via manual workflow dispatch.

###Script Functionality Breakdown:

Fetches the recent releases from a specified GitHub repository.
Downloads and extracts files from the latest release, focusing on delta files.
Filters vulnerabilities from the delta files, focusing on published ones from 2023 onwards with a CVSS base score of 5 or higher.
Formats the filtered vulnerabilities into an HTML table.
Sends an email with the specified subject, body text, and HTML, to and from the specified addresses using AWS Simple Email Service (SES).
Workflow Breakdown:

The workflow is scheduled to run daily at midnight, or upon pushes to the main branch, or via manual workflow dispatch.
It checks out the code, sets up Python environment, installs necessary dependencies, and then runs the script.
Environment variables for AWS credentials and email addresses are securely handled using GitHub Secrets.
Requirements:

Python 3.8
Libraries: requests, boto3
AWS SES set up with necessary permissions
Environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, TO_ADDRESSES
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine or GitHub workspace.
Ensure AWS credentials are set up and necessary permissions for SES are granted.
Set up GitHub Secrets for AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and TO_ADDRESSES.
To run the script locally, ensure dependencies are installed using pip install requests boto3, and run python notificator.py.
To run the script via GitHub Actions, simply push to the main branch, or use manual dispatch in the Actions tab of the repository.
Additional Notes:

Ensure that the environment variables are properly set up, either in your local environment or as GitHub Secrets for the GitHub Actions workflow.
The TO_ADDRESSES should be formatted as a comma-separated string of email addresses.
Ensure that handling and transmitting potentially sensitive data complies with all necessary data privacy laws and best practices.
